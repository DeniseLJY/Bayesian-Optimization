# Bayesian-Optimization

The upload is the code needed to implement all the experiments in our published paper DOI:10.1145/3501774.3501791

The code is to implement Bayesian Optimzaition Algorithm. The default choice of surrogate model is Gaussion Process regression.

Acquisition functions contain Expected Improvement(EI), Modified Expected Improvement (Modified_EI), Probability Improvement(PI),

Modified Probability Improvement (Modified PI), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Predictive Entropy Search (PES)
